# eslint-es6-react-flow
my common eslint configuration used for es6 / react / flow based projects

### No console output

Use a logger instead of console.log.  For the few cases where console output is needed, add an eslint exception
for the specific cases.

### Quotes

Use double quotes, except avoiding the need for escapes.
